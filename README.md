# Principles To Code By - Katas

## Code Katas that are Annotated with Best Practices backed by the leading books in Quality, Clean, and Testable Code

I have worked on Code challenges off and on over the last couple of years. Many solutions seem to focus on performance or code golf, over readability. 
Many people practice these algorithms tests for hours and hours, and I fear that people may be practicing in the wrong way, myself included.

I aim to make this repo the place where I share my journey and growth to become a developer that focuses on cleaner and less complex code that is talked about by many fine books.

I will document in my code where one can find the simple techniques that I use.

I hope that you will join this journey with me and become a better dev yourself!
